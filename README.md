# Sirris_Agriculture

Smart Solar Irrigation System (SirriS) is the system supplies solar power for sensor-controlled irrigation pumps that automatically control how water is distributed across fields, preventing over-irrigation and reducing water and diesel consumption. A pay-as-you-go system provides small-scale farmers with operating models that enable self-sufficiency in the long term. The optimized irrigation process takes into account the different crop types and the pH value of the soil.

The panel of judges was impressed by the high environmental impact of this innovative approach that addresses major global challenges surrounding agriculture, water usage and energy, especially in areas vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Controlled by smart web and mobile applications, this scalable solution offers compelling economic, ecological and social benefits according to the experts.
